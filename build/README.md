# Boggle

Standard Boggle Rules
The classic version of Boggle, originally distributed by Parker Brothers, consists of a 4 x 4 grid with 16 dice. A single letter (except for “Qu,” noted below) is printed on each of the six sides of each die. You need at least two players. 

To play:

Shake the covered tray to mix up the letter dice. Then, place it on the table so the cubes fall into place. 

Start the timer for three minutes.

Connect adjacent letters -- horizontally, vertically, or diagonally -- to unscramble and form valid words. You can zig-zag your way around the grid, but you cannot use the same cube more than once per word. Each word must be at least three letters long.

Plurals and conjugations are separate words. So, “care,” “cares” and “cared” are three separate words. 

Write down all the words you find. Each player has their own sheet of paper.

Stop when the timer runs out. 

Tally up your points by following the Boggle scoring rules below.

The winner is the player with the most points. 

If two players have the same number of points, the winner is the player who found longer words. 
The number of points you earn depends on the length of the word:

3-letter words and 4-letter words are 1 point each

5-letter words are 2 points each

6-letter words are 3 points each

7-letter words are 5 points each

8-letter words and longer are 11 points each
