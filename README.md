# Boggle

Standard Boggle Rules
The classic version of Boggle, originally distributed by Parker Brothers, consists of a 4 x 4 grid with 16 dice. A single letter (except for “Qu,” noted below) is printed on each of the six sides of each die. You need at least two players. 

To play:

1 player mode:
    first select a difficulty (default is easy) and then select "1 player" icon to start
2 player mode:
    users will take turns playing but must not see the screen while the other is playing, after the timer runs out, the second player will be propmted to start their turn by hitting enter 

Connect adjacent letters -- horizontally, vertically, or diagonally -- to unscramble and form valid words. You can zig-zag your way around the grid, but you cannot use the same cube more than once per word. Each word must be at least three letters long.

Plurals and conjugations are separate words. So, “care,” “cares” and “cared” are three separate words. 

Stop when the timer runs out. 

Tally up your points by following the Boggle scoring rules below.

The winner is the player with the most points. 
 
The number of points you earn depends on the length of the word:

3-letter words and 4-letter words are 1 point each

5-letter words are 2 points each

6-letter words are 3 points each

7-letter words are 5 points each

8-letter words and longer are 11 points each
